The objective of this research was to isolate and describe calcite-precipitating bacteria and determine whether they can be used to fortify concrete. Bacteria that are resistant to alkalis are introduced into the mixture to protect it from high pH conditions. These bacteria exhibited high levels of urease activity, leading to the precipitation of calcium carbonate as calcite. Bacillus megaterium was isolated with a concentration of 106, 107, and 108 CFU/mL.
